  Use Datree's Policy Enforcement from within your build.
  The orb includes several commands you can run during your build to enforce your policy.
  For more information check here - https://docs.datree.io/docs/datree-and-circleci

commands:
  branch-name-convention:
    description: |
      Validate that the branch name is linked to your issue tracker.
      This orb will fail your build in case the branch name doesn't contain the pattern expected by your issue tracker.
    parameters:
      issue_tracker:
        description: Name of you issue tracker. Currently Jira and Pivotal are supported.
        default: 'jira'
        type: enum

  pull-request-title-convention:
    description: |
      Validate that the pull request title is linked to your issue tracker.
      This orb will fail your build in case the pull request title doesn't contain the pattern expected by your issue tracker.
      In case the build doesn't run on a pull request, the orb will automatically continue.

      The `issue_tracker` parameter is optional (defaults to Jira)
    usage:
      orbs:
        datree: datree/policy@volatile # we advise to lock the version before pushing to production

  version-alignment:
    description: |
      Example of using Datree's version alignment rule.
      The `payload` parameter is required. In this example we run a fake job that extracts the actual installed versions from within the build.
      The `DATREE_API_KEY` parameter is required. It is possible to pass it using an environment variable of the same name.
